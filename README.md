# WebBranchedFlow

## Introduction

The branched flows are simulated in this program as particles moving in a random potential. This potential is much lower than the kinetic energy of the particle.

In this way, it simulates a scattering process.

## Options

- Set the number of path and the number of iteration before you start the simulation. 
- A big number of iterations is not usually recommended because most of the points will be outside the view.
- The number of paths will affect the performance of the app. More than 1000 paths can delay the draw of the image and it will also consume much memory.
- You can also change the value of transparency (alpha) of the paths.
